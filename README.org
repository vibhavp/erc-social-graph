A [[http://www.jibble.org/piespy/][PieSpy]]-esque social network graph module for ERC.

* Introduction
  With ~erc-social-graph~, you can generate and preview [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph][Social graphs]] using ERC,
  an IRC client for Emacs. Currently, the code only tracks direct mentions on IRC
  channels, and ignores binary conversations and private messages (both of which
  are planned for the future). This graph is stored in a standard Emacs Lisp
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hash-Tables.html][Hash Table]].
  
  This hash table can be converted to a textual graph in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)][DOT Graph Language]].
  This is a simple directed graph where each node represents an individual user, 
  while the edges represent relationships between users. The bolder the edges,
  the stronger the relationship.

  The graph can also be previewed dynamically, resulting in a graph that changes
  as messages are sent to the channel.

* Installation:
** Via package.el
   ~erc-social-graph~ is available on [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]], just add MELPA to your package
   archives, and install the package with ~M-x package-install erc-social-graph~
** Via el-get
   erc-social-graph can also be installed using [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]]. To do so, run
   ~M-x el-get-install erc-social-graph~
** Via Git:
  Clone this repo to a desired location,
  add this directory to your load-path, add the module to =erc-modules=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/erc-social-graph.el"))
  (require 'erc-social-graph)
  (erc-social-graph-enable)
  #+END_SRC
* Usage:  
  To enable social graphs, run ~M-x erc-social-graph-enable~. The module now
  scans connected channels, and updates it's hash table accordingly.
  
  ~erc-social-graph-draw~ makes a DOT graph, opens it. This file can be saved 
  to a different location with ~C-x C-w~, and compiled with Graphviz's ~dot~
  utility, or [[http://graphviz-dev.appspot.com/][various]] [[sandbox.kidstrythisathome.com/erdos/][online]] [[www.webgraphviz.com][tools]].

** Dynamic Graphs
   To enable dynamic graphs, set ~erc-social-graph-dynamic-graph~ to ~t~ with
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq erc-social-graph-dynamic-graph t)
   #+END_SRC
   Or, run ~customize-graph erc-social-graph~ and set the option to ~t~.
   When this option is set, ~erc-social-graph-draw~ runs ~dot~ with the ~-Tx11~
   option to create a new window which updates the graph as messages are sent
   to the channel.
